#### Description


#### Usage:

In the directory, there are Python scripts and Markdown files for describing the tasks. 
The scripts run on Python version 3 or higher. There are also test scripts in the directories, 
named `<module_name>_test.py`. The test scripts are run in the same way as regular Python files.
