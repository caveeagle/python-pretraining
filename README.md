<h3 align="center">BeCode Pretraining Project</h3>

#### Description

This project was created for the **beCode** pretraining course in **2025**. It contains Python scripts
for solving basic pretraining tasks, as well as test scripts. Some tasks have been modified
and solved in a more complex way.

#### Usage

In the directory, there are Python scripts and Markdown files for describing the tasks. 
The scripts run on Python version 3 or higher. There are also test scripts in the directories, 
named `<module_name>_test.py`. The test scripts are run in the same way as regular Python files.

#### Disclaimer

Many tasks were solved in a non-standard way; do not try to repeat this at home!
